## Methods
This project requires the libraries numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn, and imblearn. So, you may need to install these packages if you want to test it.

The process we outline is this:
### **1. EDA**
 - Descriptive Statistics
 - Univariate Analysis
 - Bivariate Analysis
 - Multivariate Analysis

### **2. Preprocessing**
 - Data Cleansing: Check and Handle Missing Value, Type Data, Duplicated, Outliers
 - Feature Encoding: Label Encoding and One Hot Encoding
 - Standardization
 - Class imbalance: over sampling SMOTE

### **3. Modeling** 
I tried 4 types of classification models to see which one is the best at predicting targets, such as:
 - Logistic Regression
 - Random Forest
 - Decission Tree
 - XGBoost

## Result
The following are the results of the model comparison I used:

Based on the prediction model, it can be concluded that the most suitable algorithm is **Random Forest**. This algorithm produces a high ROC_AUC value (1.00), compared to other algorithms that have relatively low values. The selection of the ROC_AUC metric is based on the focus on evaluating how well the model distinguishes between True Positive Rate and minimizes False Negative, especially since class imbalance is handled beforehand, so an appropriate metric is needed for the model to perform well.

## Business Recommendations
1. Implement a more accurate credit scoring system
> Use statistical models to assess a borrower's credit risk and determine the appropriate interest rate. Then conduct monitoring to understand how well the borrower is meeting his or her repayment obligations.
2. Develop loan products that suit borrowers' needs
> Offer different types of loans, such as short-term loans, long-term loans, and microloans.
